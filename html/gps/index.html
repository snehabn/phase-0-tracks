				What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
					* Semantic tags make the page easier to read and access for the general public and to those with disabilities. It also allows for standardization between multiple users and teams.
				What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
					* The browser first looks at the Doctype declaration to determine what langauge and interpretation the written document is in. It then translates accordingly and renders the content.
				What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
					* I learned how to make snippets and I'll definitely be using this tool in the future. 
				What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?
					*I think the there was a little lack of clarity for when to use the section and when to article elements. I think I'll be able to understand this better the more I write and build HTML pages.
