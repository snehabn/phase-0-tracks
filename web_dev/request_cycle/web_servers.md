2. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux follows open-source philosophies:

	The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
	
	The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
	
	The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
	
	The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.

3. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a small part of a dedicated server that acts as a private computer. Some advantages are that it does not cost as much as using a private dedicated server, the space of the VPS can be increased without having to migrate existing data, the VPS can be accessed remotely from anywhere, and you can decide on the operating system to run on the VPS.

4. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Running programs at a limited user level provides a layer of security for the system. If there is a bug in a code or other problems, this may prevent it from causing damage to the entire system's files.
