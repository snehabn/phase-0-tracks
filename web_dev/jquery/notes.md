jQuery

I plan on learning jQuery using two way. I am a visual learner so I plan to do some basic YouTube searches to see if there are any comprehensive videos covering the basics of jQuery. I am also planning to follow along the video(s) to get the muscle memory for the codes.

I would also like to go through Codecademy's jQuery track. I have learned really well in the past with Codecademy and I hope to at least skim through any major points I may not have come across on the YouTube videos. Codecademy is a little bit more time consuming so I am primarily going to try and go off the videos.
